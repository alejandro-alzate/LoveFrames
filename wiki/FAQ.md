**Note**: These questions are not necessarily asked frequently, but I'm posting them here anyway in the case that someone might actually need one of them answered.

>Can I use Love Frames in my project if I plan to go commercial with my project? 

Yes 

>Do I have to release my project under Love Frame's license if I use Love Frames in my project? 

No. The only requirement of Love Frame's license is that you attribute the author in your work. 

>How should I attribute the author in my work? 

All I ask is that somewhere in your credits you state that your project uses Love Frames and that I am the author of Love Frames. I'd prefer if you used my real name which is @KennyShields, but I won't mind if you use Nikolai Resokav either.
